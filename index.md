The **N**umerical **A**nalysis **R**esearch **C**lub aims to provide an informal
environment for discussing topics of interest on numerical analysis.  Each week
someone leads the discussion on:
 - their own research,
 - a topic of interest including classical papers in the field, and
 - a recent article of interest.
If you are interested in joining us please email the [organizers]
